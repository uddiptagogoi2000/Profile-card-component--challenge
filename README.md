### What I learned

In this challenge I learned positioning layouts pretty well.

Code snippets I used here to position the Profile photo in the middle is given below,

```css
.photo-wrapper {
	display: inline-block;
	border-radius: 50%;
	position: relative;
	top: 95px;
	left: 0;
	right: 0;
	margin-left: auto;
	margin-right: auto;
	background: #fff;
}
```

### Continued development

SVGs in the background of the card needs a little improvment in aligning for the mobile view.
